---

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Styled-components**  
- **Zustand**  

Additional project setup includes:

- **`.env.template`** – Provides a template of all required environment variables for the project. This ensures that any developer can easily configure their local environment without exposing sensitive data.  
- **`.nvmrc`** – Specifies the recommended Node.js version for the project. This ensures consistency across different development environments and CI/CD pipelines, avoiding version conflicts.  
- **Component testing with Storybook** – All UI components have associated stories that allow developers to visually test and interact with each component in isolation.
