- **`.nvmrc`** â€“ Specifies the recommended Node.js version for the project. This ensures consistency across different development environments and CI/CD pipelines, avoiding version conflicts.  
- **Component testing with Storybook** â€“ All UI components have associated stories that allow developers to visually test and interact with each component in isolation.
